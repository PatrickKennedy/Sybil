Common Page Elements
====================

Common page elements are any snippets which can be included into a page.
All elements should require their own namespace dictionary (eg. profile_data).

Page elements may be separated into different files using the following suffixes
and must be able to stand on their own in a page (ie. it can't be part of a
table, although at the same time <li> elements are acceptable).

_box::
    Boxes are fully self-contained elements which typically make use of the
	following elements. Boxes make it easy to rearrange and maintain elements.

_listing::
    Render lists of items. What gets listed depends on the content; for example,
	profile_listing renders a list of names and any extra information from the
	profiles passed, whereas comment_listing renders a list of full comments.

_display::
    Render the main content of the element; for example, profile_display
    handles the logic involved in rendering the displayed table.

Additionally, all elements should include some form of documentation describing
how it should be used and what options it has.
